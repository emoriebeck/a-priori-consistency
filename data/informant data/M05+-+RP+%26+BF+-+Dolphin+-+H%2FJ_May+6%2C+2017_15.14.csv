My partner's parents don't like the idea of him dating someone, so we often sneak out and lie about us hanging out. He has two houses, so we usually go to his empty house (which they are trying to sell) to spend time together. Couple of months ago, after we spent time together, I realized my phone wasn't with me when I got home. He realized he didn't turn off the heater. I was able to go back there so he told me how to get in the house so I could take care of things before his parents were coming to check the house the morning after as they were expecting visitors for the house. When I went over there, I turned off the heater and took care of things although I couldn't find my phone. But when I got out of the house, I realized the neighbors had called the police assuming that I was a burglar. The really racist and rude police forced me to let him in the house. He stepped all over the carpet with his shoes, but left when he realized I wasn't doing anything wrong. My partner and I couldn't do anything else to make this situation better. The next morning, his parents saw the footprints around and in the house. They attributed it to me, because there were small footprints around the house (it had snowed that night). They talked to him about it, said horrible things about me, including threats to call the police to have me arrested. We thought the relationship between me and his parents were getting better, but after this incident, we basically lost all hope. Because of this, my partner and I got into some major arguments and fights, but we recognized that we were both struggling to overcome this situation and got through it together. We're still together, and I would say that this event strengthened our relationship and let us see each others' true characters. 
My phone was found outside of his house, but water-damaged and crushed.
