Firstly, my stepmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and she is now in the treatment process for that. Additionally, I spent 3 months in Ecuador as a Project Supervisor for Amigos de las Americas this summer. I worked 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to ensure the health and safety of high-school aged volunteers and I facilitated their community development projects. I went through culture shock going there and am going through reverse culture shock now. I also had a very big leadership position and many responsibilities through which I learned a lot about myself.",14,11,15,3,9,6,7,2,12,9,9,6,15,13,10,10,4,4,9,10,3,7,3,11,10,14,11,14,12,12,7,11,14,10,8,10,11,11,7,8,9,8,11,11,15,14,14,12,9,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,intelligent,caring,pretentious,ungrateful,7,7,7,7,1,1,4,4,4,2,5,4,4,4,3,1,4,4,5,3,1,3,2,5,2,3,1,4,4,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,2,7,7,6,7,6,6,5,1,
