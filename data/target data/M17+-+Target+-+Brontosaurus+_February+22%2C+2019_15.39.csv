It has allowed me to do things that I enjoy and has helped me pursue and plan my future career. My two worst qualities kind of compliment my best qualities.

Not only is this intelligence in a book-wise sense, but I am also relatively sharp and able to think on my feet. This lends itself well to flexibility and adaptability, which are two of my stronger traits. I also chose boldness because I stand up for what I believe in and tend to have a fuck-all attitude when it comes to people trying to resist against progressive change.

I think this effects almost all of the social interaction I have and has a huge effect on the way that people see me and how they feel when they are around me. I just want to be happy as often as I can and I want to make the people I love feel similarly. In large part, it comes from my family and how I was raised. Laughing is so important to everybody in my family that I think making people laugh and feel happy is one of my best qualities.   I also think because I was so reserved growing up and spent more time listening and observing than talking and being the center of attention, I learned to empathize with people. I think I do a good job of understanding others and thinking from their point of view and this helps me be as kind and caring as I can possibly be. My ability to truly listen and care where other people are coming from and what they have to say has helped me become a very caring person and this is one of my favorite things about myself. It is so important to empathize with others.   I tend to be a very curious person which also may have come from how observant I have always been. I think in many ways this is a good thing, but often I take it too far and want to know other peoples business that I just don't need to know. It is hard for me to feel out of the loop or like I am missing something and I often need to just let things go instead of trying to find out other people's business. It is not a good habit to have to want to know things that people don't want to tell you and because of this I think that how nosy I am is one of my worst qualities.   I also tend to be rather judgmental of others which is very bad. I jump to conclusions about why people are the way they are or why the treat others the way they do. Again, from being so observant and reserved as a child I think I developed a habit of analyzing people and forming biases about them. I tried very hard to stop forming judgements about others too soon but that is hard for me. Instead, I have tried to form judgements that can easily be changed if people prove otherwise.

I often seek reassurance from my boyfriend and sometimes other people as well. I do not believe most of the compliments I get. I force my boyfriend to repeat his compliments over and over while I protest them until either I believe him or we both get angry. My body image is terrible; I do not see myself as I truly am. I believe myself to be fat and I see fat in the mirror (this is of course a part of my anorexia). I often believe I am an ugly person.  My narcissism disgusts me. I believe myself to be more intelligent than almost everyone. I am always right. I often think my actions/motives are morally superior to those around me, though in fact I'm just as messed up. I pride myself on hating ""normalcy"" and yet I desperately wish to be ""popular"" as if I've never gotten over high school. I have periods where I believe I know everything. I suspect I am also self righteous and rely on my privilege to get what I want. I do try hard to not act on my narcissism though.  My two best traits, empathy and reading people, kind of go hand in hand. I am generally very good with people, unless I am in a vulnerable state myself. Having been through a lot of trauma and suffering, I am atuned to other peoples' emotions and behavior. I am very empathetic, I can put myself in most people's shoes and feel their pain- almost to a fault. This is a characteristic of my borderline personality disorder. I am good at reading people, though sometimes I over-read. I am always the one helping others and listening to their problems. I've been told I give good advice.

The two traits really go hand-in-hand, because compassion involves being concerned for others, and then selflessness involves taking steps to put the need of other before your own so as to improve their situation. Having these two traits enables me to really want to and to try to make a difference in the lives of those around me.  I said that distractibility is one of my worst qualities becasue I am a very very busy person, and being distactible makes me waste a lot of precious time on insignificant tasks. It causes me to get even less sleep than I would otherwise. I said that my over-analytical nature is another of my worst qualities, because it can get on people's nerves sometimes.

Specifically, I have a good memory, which allows me to do well on exams with less effort. True, it makes it hard for me to relate to some of my peers when they struggle, it makes me less forgiving and more arrogant, but overall it's helped me in my life. On the other hand, loyalty is what helps me to maintain what few friendships I do have. Most of the problems in my life are due to what I've come to think of as bad habits. I don't like changing my routine, and once I am aware of something, the way certain things are, I will do what I can to ensure those things never change. My eating disorder is more of a routine than anything. My continued interaction with an individual who has no positive impact on my life is a habit. I become disturbed when the details fall out of place, shift slightly. It's one of the downsides to having a good memory, I suppose--you know exactly the way things were, and that makes it hard to let go. This sort of goes hand in hand with my critical nature. I'm hard to impress. I don't really compliment people, because most people aren't exceptional. I'm jealous of people who are truly skilled, since I can recognize that I'm not.

I think that often being happy is a choice.  Obviously choices that you make influence if you are happy, but more importantly than that I think happiness is a choice that you make in reaction to circumstances.  Given the circumstances that you are under, you can choose to make the best of it and be happy about and focus on the good things, or you can choose to mope and complain about the bad things.  I've always believed in getting out any feelings of anger, sadness, unhappiness and then moving on so you can go back to being happy.  I think that my ability to always be happy has made my life a lot better.  I can be really impatient especially with people.  When I'm trying to explain something to someone I get worked up if they don't understand what I'm saying and it can come off as condescending when in reality it's more that I'm frustrated with myself for not being able to convey what I mean.    I am secretly very judgmental, usually of strangers.  I make snap judgements about people based on how they look, or a snippet of conversation that I overheard.  It's kind of silly because I usually don't have any interaction with these people, I just make assumptions as I walk past.  Intelligence has opened a lot of doors for me and let me achieve things that not everyone could.  It's always helped me make the best of situations as I figure out what is the best things to do.

It allows me to relate and form bonds with many people. It also puts me in the position to be open to experiences so that I have a more enjoyable life whether that is about food or adventures with friends and family. Intellectual is another good quality because I am a thinker that likes to have deep discussion with others. It helps me to form bonds with and have fulfilling and substantial conversation with others.  My worst qualities are that I worry often and that I am insecure. Being insecure is a poor quality because I easily doubt myself and my decisions. I tend to be very indecisive which makes things hard for me and the people around me. Worrying is also a bad quality because it takes a toll on me as well as my best friend and girlfriend. I tend to ruminate which can be debilitating for me as I won't be able to get anything done but also frustrating for those closest to me.,2,,,"came out to my parents, moved and lived away for the summer",2,9,14,4,12,12,6,9,7,11,7,7,7,5,2,1,2,3,4,1,1,1,3,1,2,2,3,3,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,3,3,4,3,3,3,1,7,11,13,5,12,4,12,8,10,15,18,5,18,19,14,18,7,5,5,12,4,14,4,12,,18,19,19,7,8,4,19,12,12,6,18,19,13,8,12,10,7,8,5,18,18,15,18,10,15,18,15,4,17,12,7,14,18,14,11,19,20,20,20,19,15,15,15,15,12,1,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,10,10,10,10,10,10,7,8,15,5,13,11,6,19,10,13,17,12,13,8,11,6,11,13,18,11,18,11,5,15,5,17,6,4,17,13,10,7,6,18,10,17,17,11,16,5,15,18,19,7,11,19,15,15,15,15,8,15,10,11,10,17,19,11,19,10,10,15,12,20,20,20,19,15,18,17,18,19,,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,10,7,7,10,7,10,6,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Andrea Garces,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,Max Fleisher,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,5,4,Ashley Jeffrey,1,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,10,8,Derek Krinock,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,3,4,Maria Alvarez,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,German Romero,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,3,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,

I'm constantly planning things, trying to get myself to do something important, and being lazy has impacted my life in pretty much every way, whether it is academic, monetary, socially - being lazy is simply a negative trait to have and my default tendency is to trend towards laziness.   After college, I have realized that I take a lot of relationships for granted. There are fewer opportunities to make friends and it's important to maintain those that you have already. I suppose that ""Funny"" would be more adequately described as a good sense of humor. Laughter, itself, is an act that connects people, whether it's sharing the enjoyment of a joke in a group setting or laughing at a movie or game. I'm happy to be able to make people laugh as I genuinely think that it helps in keeping these friendships alive or making new friendships.   I've kind of realized that I'm also an overly critical person, and not critical enough on myself. I think I can be overly negative about people and I am working to change that. I like to think that I'm an optimist about situations and I like that about myself. It's important to see the bright side in life. ",1,"confident of myself, lonely and isolated, and independent.

This is a skill I have developed over the past few months in response to a major career setback in an attempt to better understand why I was not successful in this particular undertaking. I now have the ability to step back and evaluate a situation to see how my actions and behaviors influence the reactions of others. Impulsivness is one of my worst traits because it often gets me in trouble when I act without thinking first. This most often occurs when I am angry, but also in instances where I fail to consider the consequences of my actions. I will sometimes try and justify my impulsive actions by reasoning that the rules don't apply to me or thinking that someone deserves a thorough rebuke because they are inherently lesser than me.

If I say I will do this or be somewhere I make sure that I follow through with that. I think it also helps a lot in being a good friend because being a reliable/consistent is necessary. The same is true for work and work relationships. I listed being objective as the other positive trait because currently there are several high-profile and controversial events in the media (Michael Brown and Eric Granger). In these situations and all others that might come up being able to want to at least try and understand someone's perspective ESPECIALLY if it differs from your own is so necessary in not only keeping the peace, but also avoiding a one-track mind.   For negative attributes I listed being scatter brain and being stubborn. I listed being scatter-brain is an issue beause it allowed me to get very easily side-tracked.

I have become friends with people who aren't used to being treated well by their other friends and they tell me that they appreciate how I treat them. I don't see any reason to be anything but kind to people. There is no point in being rude or unnecessarily mean to someone even when you are frustrated because it will never accomplish anything productive. I believe that people are inherently kind but continuous negative interactions with others who have treated them poorly may have led them to become defensive and not expect people to treat them with respect. My parents raised me to be kind to everyone I meet and that is something I will carry with me forever. Kindness comes easily but patience is something I have had to learn over time. Most people generally expect immediate results or get upset if things don't go their way the first time but I have learned that persistence and patience will lead to better results. I have also learned that being patient with people will lead to strengthened relationships. I haven't been in any ""fights with any of my friends since I was very young because we've all learned that outbursts and giving each other the cold shoulder until someone gives in is not the way to solve problems. Giving each other breathing room and talking things out is the preferable solution. I admire people who are patient and understanding most of the time and I strive to be that way too. I think that my biggest insecurities stem from past relationships and friendships which were unhealthy and led me to doubt myself in ways that I rationally know that I shouldn't. The rational side of me knows that I am worthy and my thoughts and opinions are valid and important but sometimes a large part of me doubts all of that. In class I am often too nervous to raise my hand and share my ideas even though I know that contributing what I think will help the discussion progress. However, my insecurities sometimes drag me down and it is difficult to overcome them. Another insecurity that I've carried with me since I was very young is insecurity with my weight. Although I am of a normal and healthy weight for my age and height now, I used to be slightly overweight as a child and people's comments have stuck with me for over a decade. I can usually ignore them and am relatively happy with my appearance but sometimes I have bad days or weeks when I can't shake the feeling that I need to lose weight to be beautiful.  Not standing up for myself is something that I am still working on overcoming. I have gotten a lot better at this throughout my time here at school but sometimes I still struggle to let people know when they are doing something that is making me feel uncomfortable. In order to avoid conflict I'll often not bring up things that my roommates are doing that are really bothering me. For example, I took out the trash almost every time for the entire first semester of this year because neither of my roommates wanted to. I was usually the first to give in because I hate not cleaning up after myself or seeing trash pile up. Near the end of the semester I decided I wasn't going to take it out so I waited. One of my roommates ended up calling me out and saying that we can't keep waiting until the other person caves and that she would take it out this time but we would have to take turns from then on. This infuriated me but I still did not say anything about it to anyone. After that I made sure to bring up the topic to them and now we're on a cycle where we take turns every time. It's been working very well. I wish I would've done it sooner though and although I am proud of myself I still wish I was better at standing up for myself.  Another example is that my best friend from here who is also one of my roommates has an incredibly extroverted personality. She does not have a lot of close friends because she often comes off as too aggressive and overly opinionated. She's turned out to be one of the best friends I've ever had because once she lets down her wall she's actually an incredibly kind and caring person. However, sometimes she does say things that she shouldn't say to me or does things that hurt my feelings and although I have gotten better at not taking it to heart it is still difficult for me to tell her how I feel when she says those things. It's something I will continue to work on and grow with.

I believe this is a beneficial skill to have anywhere.   It was actually more difficult to come up with these this time around, than my past PAIRS surveys.  I'm not sure why.  Last year was a rather large turning point for me.  I took a year off from school and worked my butt off.  went from an office paper boy to assistant operations manager in one year.  It was crazy, I learned so much, and changed considerably as a person.   I don't like to say it this way (because it's not exactly accurate) but it helped me overcome my depression.  mature a bit, maybe.

As far as openness, I feel as though life is an adventure, and it is this attitude that has kept me wanting to learn more.  For introversion and lack of confidence, that's simple. I'm in the business school and I need to constantly make a good impression in front of my peers and participate in class.

After I lost my brother last year it just seemed really futile and counter-productive to keep trying to make everything seem perfect.  My depression and anxiety are very intrinsic to my personality. I don't see them so much as disorders but as part of me, even though that kind of sucks. I have become incredibly pessimistic and jaded at a young age, perhaps because of the vast amount of traumatic events that have taken place in my life.

Additionally, I like to be non-judgmental and open-minded when interacting with others, which I think is a positive quality.

I have to stay calm and take things one at a time, because I can't afford to drop the ball, and I'd like to maintain some illusion of sanity while I'm at it.  I think what I'm most unhappy about right now are my relationships. I find it very difficult to make close friends rather than acquaintances, and I think part of that is because I am shy.

If asked to complete a task or meet with someone, I have a strong motivation to follow through on these plans. One of my other best qualities is kindness because I make an effort to understand the circumstances of others and offer them support when I can. I prefer being agreeable, and even when I encounter someone whose opinion is very different from mine, I would prefer having a discussion and being polite rather than arguing with them.  In turn, this preference also reflects that I am somewhat timid. Since I prefer keeping peace, I avoid speaking up or being assertive when necessary. I worry that what I have to say might be wrong or challenged in a way in which I cannot offer an intelligent response, so I often hesitate and choose not to aggravate an issue. Another of my worst qualities is that I can be indecisive and a bit of a perfectionist. Perhaps I have a desire to please everyone and I worry that my choices won't be accepted.

Rather than automatically assuming someone is ""finally showing their true colors"" or is simply a bad and/or lazy person, being compassionate allows room for other stories. Maybe someone is just having a bad day or is simply not doing well, and that is okay. It doesn't mean something terrible is wrong with them or that they're the scum of the earth. Similarly, being attentive allows me to quickly realize if someone is in a bad spot and perhaps needs some help or encouragement. It's easy to brush small stuff off, but sometimes a well-timed compliment or a genuine ""How are you?"" can go a long way. It also keeps me in touch with my own feelings and thoughts. I chose nervousness as one of my worse traits because it prevents me from fully enjoying my experiences with other people. I get caught up thinking about the impression I'm making or how I look to others or if I'm being understood, and it can be difficult to fully process what my conversation partner is trying to communicate. In a related manner, negativity can hinder my growth by causing me to avoid my flaws or issues by denying their existence. Rather than address problems, I'd prefer to bypass the negative feelings associated with them by putting them away. Negativity can also color my interactions in a bad way, whether past or present.",1,aware of my own motives and intentions.,consumed with work and worry about academics.,I am currently residing in another country.,12,6,,7,8,4,9,9,9,12,7,7,7,5,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,2,4,3,3,2,4,2,4,4,2,4,3,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,5,3,2,4,3,2,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,12,15,5,10,4,15,16,12,10,18,7,18,11,11,18,11,16,6,14,8,12,4,13,13,18,16,18,12,19,4,11,14,12,18,13,11,18,10,11,19,14,10,7,13,14,14,18,14,14,14,19,11,17,13,13,18,11,13,19,10,20,20,20,20,12,15,12,12,17,,1,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,10,7,6,7,10,10,5,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Juliet Goodman,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,7,3,Chiezda Mupanomunda,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,10,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nikki Gomez,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,6,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,

More importantly than that, however, is the idea that my intelligence (coupled with hard work, of course) will be able to get me where I want to go in life.  I feel that by being smart when I was younger, I was given opportunities that even kids at my school weren't, and this in turn helped me get to where I am today.  On the other hand, I chose compassionate as my second important trait because I feel as though this also plays a large part in helping me get where I want to go in the future.  Aloofness causes me to have trouble connecting with others and my stubbornness sometimes inhibits my ability to have an open mind and to engage in productive discussions with others.

It's also one of my favorites parts of me. The same goes with my sass. Confidence also spreads to all areas of my life. I'm very rarely insecure about anything because of this. I don't care if I'm not the most attractive or have the best grades because I am confident in my own abilities and know what I am capable of. My sass is more of my sense of humor. It's the 'maybe what she's saying is offensive, but I can't be sure because she's saying it with a smile' kind of humor.  I have also been told I can be cold and rude at time. This what it seems like because I am not afraid to tell people what I think of them, and they often do not like my honesty. I also often don't have patience for the emotions of others, which is why I seem cold. The rudeness however comes from my assertiveness. If someone wants me to do something I don't want to do, I'll tell them I don't want to do it. For example, one of my friends has a minuscule role in a play about black oppression in the 1950's and wanted us to see her in it. I however did not want to watch a four hour play about black oppression in the 1950's when my friend has a single line in it, so I told her that in slightly nicer words.",2,,,n/a,13,13,10,9,11,15,8,14,14,14,5,6,6,5,4,5,1,1,1,3,1,2,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,8,19,7,15,4,13,11,6,8,14,5,8,7,6,14,13,16,14,14,4,10,11,16,13,17,7,10,18,4,7,14,11,6,10,14,4,11,7,4,5,12,6,8,11,15,8,14,13,13,7,5,15,6,13,18,19,6,12,12,12,20,20,20,19,15,12,18,19,19,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,6,10,6,6,6,7,6,8,Katie Elliott,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,10,8,Julia Mandel,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,7,8,Adam Rawot,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,5,5,Mia Kweskin,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,6,4,Ari Ireland,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,4,3,Yiuling Punyamurthy,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,10,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Naveen Punyamurthy,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,7,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,

While being stubborn and sticking by your idea can be good at times, I think I frequently invest too much effort into getting what I believe is the best result out. I will sometimes not always take the best approach to solve problems because I will be distracted by the need and ability to see how to solve them in practical terms. Controlling is a detriment because it makes me tend towards obsessive with my own life. For example, I cannot just eat healthily, I must eat the most healthy possible.

The act of sharing a perspective with one person only to change that stance or opinion in their absence is not only a betrayal of their acquaintance, but a betrayal of who they are. I believe people should be themselves despite any extenuating circumstances.  My honesty can lead me to be a bit blunt. For instance, when people are going out rather than making up and excuse of why I can't make it though I want to (when I don't) I'm much more likely to simple decline and let them draw their own assumptions.

Being selfish is one of my worst traits because I sometimes don't take into account other people's feelings when making decisions, and I hurt people because of that. I think about what would be best for me, but the feelings of others should matter too. Over-thinking things is another undesirable trait that I possess because it causes me to overanalyze my life and my relationships.

The ability to listen also affords me infinite opportunities to learn, understand, and reach out to new people. Perseverance is what allows me to work in fields where success may not be apparent to me, nor is it always guaranteed by any independent action on my part. Much of what defines ""success"" is dependent on others, so understanding that while working as hard as possible will afford me the best chance at success, one ""failure"" does not define who I am as a person or as a worker in the field.  Although I have developed a multiple calendar and reminder system to keep me organized, I get frustrated when I forget important meetings or facts that, in hindsight, would have been helpful for me to have handy.

This could be a dangerous thing, but I usually judge myself solely on the reactions of my friends. For example, I am ensured that I am a kind person through the remarks that my friends make. So overall, being a modest person gets in the way of how I judge myself. Therefore, I know what my best qualities are just from my friends.  I sort of touched on this in the previous paragraph, but some of my downfalls include me being a very reserved and shy individual. It takes me a long time to open up to people.

I see myself as very high on the spectrum of creativity. I make films, graphic design, websites, have started a business, etc.  Attention seeking isn't good because it make me feel insecure when I don't get enough attention from others, especially in groups. I think this stems from being an only child and getting a lot of attention as a kid. I can shut down when I'm with others if I feel neglected or picked on, even if by friends I love and trust. This is bothersome and I wish I didn't feel like this sometimes. Insecure goes off of this.

I'm aware that I'm not the smartest person in the world, and I dislike making a show of my intelligence, but I know that I'm more gifted with intelligence than most people. It's the one quality I'm /sure/ I have and can rely on. Creativity has also always been a part of my life, and my (perhaps overly) active imagination has always tried to manifest itself. I've always felt a need to create, whether it be with Lego or in-class writing exercises as a kid, or music, poetry, and short stories now that I'm in college. My creativity and intelligence go hand-in-hand to help me with what I consider my best skill--writing poetry and fiction.  My entire life, I've been extremely quick to anger, and my emotions can change very quickly. I was extremely violent in elementary and middle school, and while I have mostly gotten my emotions under control today, I still get angry at computer problems very quickly, and can sometimes overreact to the things my friends say and do to me. At the same time, I can go from being in a perfectly normal mood one day to morbidly depressed the next, with absolutely no reason. When this happens, I can get angry at my friends even more easily than usual. Meanwhile, I seem to tire out all the people I talk to after just a few minutes, so I'm not certain if this is because I'm annoying or because I'm boring, but I would at least guess that it's one of these two.

Being stubborn only contributes to that problem because I consider it all but impossible to drop an argument once it's been started and it's very difficult to change my mind.",2,,,N/A,12,12,15,8,8,8,11,8,8,12,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,1,3,2,2,2,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,3,2,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,6,19,12,19,11,10,19,7,7,12,8,19,13,13,13,8,8,5,11,8,11,8,19,11,11,12,12,12,19,19,19,7,7,10,19,6,19,11,19,10,19,6,13,13,15,12,15,15,10,10,12,13,7,7,13,6,12,18,15,15,10,15,15,15,15,17,17,16,16,16,1,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,10,10,10,10,10,10,7,8,13,6,11,7,12,19,14,19,19,13,13,5,13,19,11,14,14,19,19,12,19,12,19,12,12,8,6,12,6,15,11,18,12,11,6,12,6,12,19,11,19,14,19,18,13,11,12,18,18,18,13,19,6,6,14,13,12,19,14,14,14,18,18,18,18,16,16,16,16,16,,,1,,1,,,1,,,,,,,6,6,6,6,7,10,5,3,Chelsea Branson,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,1,Old roommate,7,3,Meredith Agran,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Former friend,8,5,Adam Seighman,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,4,Katie Piette,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,7,4,Christian Ralph,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,3,4,Teresa Hillsman,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,10,3,Mike Dobuski,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,6,4,Laura Hillsman,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,10,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,

Having a good sense of humor helps to make life more enjoyable and less stressful. Being open minded I think is a good quality because it allows you to experience new things and life is all about experiences. I feel like I make an effort to try as many new things as I can even if just simply to be able to say that i've done them. When I'm old and can't make new experiences as easily, I can rest easy knowing that I've done my best to have as many cool experiences as I could.   Sometimes i become moody for very small reasons. It is hard to see past this cloud because it consumes me and just makes me feel down and serious. Usually, I can overcome this mood and then forget it ever happened, but until the cloud passes its hard to see past it. When I believe that I am right about something it is often times hard to change my mind at all.

In school, even when I have been having trouble in school, I have been able to reflect on my own actions and change myself in order to perform better. I believe that no matter what happens, however, I can trust that I worked as hard as could have. At the same time, it also helps me notice details about what is going on around me, whether the students I tutor are stressed or worried or if my friends' behavior has changed. When this happens, openness helps me share my feelings and my issues with my friends, which helps them feel comfortable enough to share what is bothering them, thus helping us be closer and them to feel better. Despite my attention to detail, I sometimes have trouble paying attention to everything people are saying when we're having conversations. As a result, I sometimes make errors when repeating back to people what they said to them, which can reflect poorly on how involved I am in the conversation and how much I care about it. Additionally, sometimes I spend too much time worrying about mistakes I have made (such as mishearing people) and about what I could have done better, but I think this quality has improved over time.",1,Relaxed,Worried,"I got offered a position as a Resident Assistant, as well as a position as a research assistant for a lab on campus.",13,13,14,11,14,10,10,14,12,13,7,6,7,6,3,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,2,4,4,2,2,2,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,11,6,15,11,13,11,15,19,19,14,11,4,15,10,13,10,14,6,11,12,19,11,5,11,14,11,6,12,10,12,7,15,12,18,7,12,6,14,6,13,6,13,8,11,15,13,15,15,13,15,12,12,7,17,14,14,12,14,15,15,15,20,20,20,19,15,12,12,15,15,1,1,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,10,10,10,10,10,10,7,8,12,5,11,6,11,8,10,12,11,13,11,10,11,7,13,11,13,13,7,8,19,8,10,12,12,11,7,19,8,12,12,12,6,11,7,11,10,10,7,11,6,11,11,11,14,12,14,13,12,13,11,11,7,5,12,19,12,8,15,12,12,19,18,18,18,17,15,15,15,15,,,1,,1,,,1,,,,,,,6,6,7,6,6,7,4,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor Chester,,1,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,7,4,Kevin Wu,,1,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,7,3,Meredith Pollock,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,6,5,Victoria Tyrone,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,5,5,Ellen Speck,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,10,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sam Speck,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,7,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2,

I find things more interesting as a result, and life is a lot more fun if you get pumped about it. I think a lot of my friends enjoy my enthusiasm above all, and it's definitely a part of me that I feel strongly about as well. Though I'm never going to be the kindest person, the smartest person, or the most important person in the room, I can definitely be the most enthusiastic and can contribute to dynamic situations as such. I am also a very loyal person, and I believe very strongly that it is important to forge close relationships and keep them. Nowadays, people are less loyal than in the past, whether it's in marriages, workplaces, etc, probably because we have so much choice available to us. I think that it's rather sad, because the best relationships are often the ones you have to groom and work for over a long period of time. My most valuable friendships have also been those in which I have had disagreements or arguments; getting through the bad times and staying loyal to a person you know is your friend makes the relationship better.  I like to talk about myself too much, and I definitely spend too much time in my own head. It's better in relationships to be a good listener, but I instead have a tendency to be cocky and ramble on and on about my own successes, stories and achievements. I like to do so, and I like the admiration I get, but it's definitely not a trait that I'm proud of, and i try and keep my boasting to a minimum. I do think of myself too highly as well, especially since i know cognitively that I'm pretty average among my peers. I don't think of myself as better than others, but I often feel it.

Also because I want to be the type of person that inspires others to be the best versions of themselves, it's very rewarding. ^_^ Empathy: Through persistently applying myself towards the goal of understanding people, I have found myself in positions where I have understanding for many sides of a battlefield and feel pain for each side's hurt, but also that they don't realize how similar they actually are, and with fair frequency that other people aren't actually disagreeing. Empathy helps me humanize, helps me have way more friends in the world than ""enemies"".  Energy: When I can't bring myself to accomplish any of the things I want to do with my life, let alone the insipid, tedious tasks of mundane life that help me accomplish those things, it's incredibly damaging to not just the short term tasks, but also my self-esteem and confidence in my ability to achieve, feeding together into a dark downward spiral. Self-discipline/focus: There's this... ability, this... stuff, that some types of people like entrepreneurs seem to have in droves, that allows them to keep pushing themselves towards their goals, despite all setbacks, distractions, deterrents, or erstwhile painfully unrelated but necessary tasks (cf. Energy above). It's self-discipline when it's choosing to do the necessary things, and it's focus when I'm doing any of the things and get distracted, but it seems to be the same stuff. And the thing is, having an organizational system, having external structure, would help with this area a ton, but I don't have that, either, so it's one of my biggest problem areas and sources of feeling ineffective.",1,"Understanding, tolerant, trusting, open, confident, inspired, connected, stable, self-aware, possessed of a broad worldview and my place in it.","Shortsighted, suspicious, unstable, unconfident, stressed","I graduated! :D Also!

A couple to add to the list would be Kefu Lu, who I interact with almost daily, as he's been my roommate for the last year, and I expect we'll continue talking quite a bit, and Jonathan Parsons, who I've been running with three times a week. I'm also fairly certain Kefu would be good at answering surveys promptly -- far better than me. :D Sorry for delays! On the romantic partner thing, which I commented on a bit before: I identify as a relationship anarchist, basically, so they're kind of akin to romantic partners, but also I have several people in mind when I say that, so those questions are hard to answer... Also! Pronouns. Lindy's pronouns are they/them, so when the questions used ""s/he"" and ""his/her"" it actually felt... off... xD  Again, sorry for delays, and thank you so much for letting me be a part of this!!"
