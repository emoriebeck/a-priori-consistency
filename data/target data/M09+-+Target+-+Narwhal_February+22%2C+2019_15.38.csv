For the self and for psychological happiness, it's important to be true to yourself - that's something I see in truly happy people and I strive to be completely myself to be satisfied with life. Loyalty to me is vital. A person needs to remain steadfast and cherish relationships, which to me, is shown through loyalty. Moody is my worst quality since I think being more even-keel is preferable, but I know that I can vary in moods, sometimes without a good reason. I don't think it's becoming and I know that's not something I generally see as a good thing in others. Being stubborn isn't completely bad; however, it has to do a lot with pride which gets in the way of realizing early on when it's a good time to see something from a different perspective or when to relent instead of continuing to hold a grudge.

Sometimes I feel rushed when needless time is taken up with waiting or doing things inefficiently. I wish I could be as patient as some of my friends and family that I know, and I try to take a breather when things become frustrating. At times I can also be selfish, usually only with little things - getting an extra cookie, the better seat, or listening to the music I prefer on the radio.

I would say that I have a somewhat restless mind, and I like both imagining new stories and hearing the stories of others.   I think I'm quite caring towards the ones I love.  Although I get easily frustrated at them sometimes, I always make an effort to improve the lives of my family, friends and romantic partners.  I am usually very accommodating in relationships, focusing on my partner rather than myself. I can be a bit spiteful at times, holding grudges unnecessarily.  I will try to take petty revenge on those who wrong me instead of finding a constructive solution. I can also be a bit lazy.  My room is always disorganized and I sometimes do not study enough.

Kindness is going above and beyond for friends, family or people that you know. Treating people with kindness earns you respect, and that is something I believe I also have.  I can be very timid when I am in a big group of people, or with people who have more experience, age, or wisdom than I do. Sometimes that gets in the way of me being seen, or can mess with me a little bit, which makes me more shy. Finally, my patience is something that comes and goes.

I go to new places on my own in a very whimsical, I feel like doing this today kind of way. I'm not afraid to try new things, except food. I can try any new activity just fine, can't do food though, foods are hard.   By shy I mean socially inhibited. I have a very hard time talking to people that I kinda know and don't have any interest in pursuing as a friend. Small talk is hard. I often differ to silence because it is much easier than speaking up. There are a lot of group dynamics that effect if I will be inhibited, as in groups of introverts I usually end up happily talking very much. But yeah, talking is not always my strong suit. Sometimes it is.   And ""unrealistic"" is more like anti realistic. I don't like to dwell on real problems, I prefer to imagine possibilities than remain tied down to something concrete.

I think having a positive outlook allows me to appreciate the little things in life which ultimately makes me a happier person.  Having a positive outlook also prevents me from getting too down on myself, even under the constant stresses that come from being a student and athlete at WashU.  I consider myself a fairly resilient person, which I think is a result of having a positive outlook.  In addition, I really enjoy being a friendly person.  There is nothing better than making someone's day a bit brighter through a friendly interaction.     Often, I struggle to make myself do the school work necessary to truly learn and succeed at WashU.  I think my work ethic was much better in high school when the expectations were laid out for me and homework was given nearly every day.  I know I am capable of doing very well in all of my classes if I would apply myself, but I find myself procrastinating and allowing myself to be distracted far too often.  I struggle with my own confidence.  When I am comfortable in a situation, I can be goofy but in large groups or around new people I tend to be more reserved, which, unfortunately, does not let my personality shine through.  In addition, I am not very comfortable speaking up in the classroom.  While all my classes are large lectures this year, I know I struggle with this at WashU.  This quality is incredibly frustrating because I felt this summer really helped me ""come into myself"" and learn to be comfortable in my own skin.  Through this fall, my confidence has been declining steadily.

My friends can always look to me for good advice and a good laugh. I am also an extremely tender-hearted and sympathetic soul. When I was younger, I remember giving some of my favorite toys to my cousins when they would visit because they liked them so much. I was always aware when I was more fortunate than others, which was very rare, and never didn't give a homeless person a few bucks or donate a few to charity.  Reversely, though, I am quite selfish with my time, which often leads to laziness. I'd rather watch a movie and eat than go for a jog, and I avoid chores as often as possible in favor of interacting with friends.

I honestly really enjoy running, and it has become a big part of my life. People think I'm crazy for doing this, but I get up before 6am every day and go for a run before classes. I'm also pretty disciplined about going to bed around 10:30pm in order to get enough sleep. In terms of academics, I think I'm relatively disciplined as well; I don't procrastinate nearly as much as I've seen some of my peers procrastinate. I'm generally a very optimistic person, and I tend to see the bright side of things. I really dislike hanging around people who complain a lot and people who are negative all the time. In my opinion, things always go better and big tasks seem more manageable when you approach them with optimism. Being optimistic helps me set goals and work hard to achieve them. As for bad qualities, I'm definitely a very judgmental person. I think I do a good job of not letting it show; I definitely won't be offensive to someone's face and I try to treat everyone as equals, but in my mind, I definitely judge people for their appearance and superficial behaviors. If the person's first impression is not actually an accurate representation of them, I try to allow for that, but I do base a lot of my attitudes towards someone on first impressions. I also feel like I'm kind of exclusive. My closest friends definitely get a lot more kindness and generosity from me than people I'm not as close with. Also, when I'm the one in charge of an event, I usually purposefully try to include only people that I genuinely like.

Sometimes I even get so bored of the situation that I toy with how people perceive me or my intentions.

The importance of working hard was instilled in me at a very young age by my mom and my grandparents. I greatly admire people who are hard workers, especially my mom, who supported my siblings and I as a single mother. I believe that even if you aren't as smart as someone else, or have as many natural talents as someone else, by working hard, you can make up for any shortcomings. Being compassionate is also something I pride myself on because I think it is something you rarely find in today's world. I am getting my MPH degree because I care about the health of those who the rest of the world has forgotten or mostly ignore. Compassion is something that everyone should try and express in order to make the world a little bit better. I try to do something every day to show my compassion.   Being stubborn and holding grudges is something I am trying to work on, but it is very difficult for me. I think it shows weakness to be stubborn and not forgive and forget.

I think loyalty to the most important people in ones life is a worthy goal, because other individuals are so often a catalyst for personal growth and enrich our lives, so we should safeguard these relationships by being loyal. Physical and mental strength are important too. Physical strength that comes from exercise improves our cognitive functioning and makes us sharper and happier. Mental strength allows us to acquire skills and complete projects. Seeing how important these qualities I have are, I would say that they are the best qualities I possess. Being stubborn and grudgy are too fairly similar things actually. Both reflect an unwillingness to let go of a victim complex and overcome interpersonal wounds. While some might say this protects one from being hurt in the future, I think that we miss so much more by closing ourselves off like that, so it would be better if I could change these traits of mine.

To decide which words to use I googled a list of personality qualities and chose words that seemed to describe me well. I think when choosing these words, I thought of past experiences and what qualities have made me get farther in life and what qualities have caused problems for me. I also was probably a little biased and judged myself based on recent experiences. I chose loving as a best quality because I do find myself really appreciating all my relationships with friends and family. I really care about my family and friends. It can also be a weakness because I can start to like people too fast before I know them very well and end up getting disappointed. But, i think this is still a good quality to have. I think being passionate and loving the people in my life are what gets my through a lot of hard times. Intelligence is another trait I chose because I do feel like I am a smart individual. I am proud of what I have achieved through education and work and think that my intelligence has gotten me where I am today. I am definitely very overemotional. That is probably highly related to the loving quality. I can get attached to people too easily and get upset about things too easily. Because i can sometimes be overtrusting and overattached to people, I get too emotional. I can get upset about very little things and I think it sometimes ends up pushing people away from me. I also get too angry about little things on occassion. Me being judgmental is another huge flaw of mine. While i do find it easy to really like people, i can be incredibly judgmental against those I don't like. I can be closeminded when it comes to meeting new people. I tend to judge people before i know them and my judgments aren't always correct. ",2,,,I have studied abroad!

I like to push myself mentally and my own intuition is something I try to challenge.  I love to think about things, sometimes they make me worry but mostly I find my inner world fascinating.  This feeds my competitive side, which I think is one of my more important traits that is both good and bad.  Distractability is I think my worst trait currently since I don't like focusing on tasks to the point where I am jeopardizing my future.  (I also browsed the internet in another tab while completing this survey, and took it a while after getting the email for it.)  This means that social situations are sometimes hard for me and I do not always show common courtesy, other times going out of my way to be overly courteous.  I also have a physical and emotional comfort zone that my current living environment affords me, so I don't have a drivers license and don't like going out too much, inconveniencing friends and making doing things I want to do sometimes harder.

On the other hand, I kind of self-diagnosed myself with a case of narcissism and I feel like it sometimes warps my perception of situations. I focus too much on myself and not on other people's perspectives. I know a few narcissistic people and they're annoying to me, so I'm trying to limit my own narcissism to make myself less annoying. As for willpower, I really wish I had more of it. Lately, I've noticed improvements on this, but in the past I haven't been able to focus on anything.

I am incredibly dependable and fiercely defend the people and causes I care about, even when they are controversial. I think similarly, my identity as a leader stems from my independence and willingness to speak my mind. I excel at working with people, and am good at delegating tasks and creating a supportive working environment where people are comfortable.   My friends often joke that I'm needy but I think we all know it's somewhat true, although it's a trait that would only be noticed by my very close friends. I am a person who enjoys spending a lot of time with others, and I can be fairly indecisive, so I rely on my best friends for company and advice/assistance with decision making probably a lot more than the average person. My friends also do a lot for me in terms of cooking, driving me places, etc. Being self-centered is closely interrelated with this; I think I often don't notice how much my friends do for me or how much I ask of them. I get easily wrapped up in my own needs/problems and sometimes don't consider that others may not be as invested or may have their own problems to deal with. I also tend to dominate conversations which could lead to others perceiving me as self-centered, though the primary cause is that I often feel awkward during pauses in conversation.

On the flip-side I would say my worst traits are being scatterbrain and judmental. Scatterbrain because at times it makes it hard for myself to stay focused and can also be difficult to keep people with me in conversation. Additionally, being scatterbrain also leaves me quite vulnerable to forget things, which i do quite often. Judgemental I said because not only does it prevent me from loving on people the way I ought, but it can also show up in my facial expressions which means others get bad vibes from me before we have even interacted.

If one cannot laugh at the problems and trials that come your way, it makes them a lot harder to deal with. Also, laughter is a great cure for a lot of problems.

Trust and beliefs fall under my worst because no matter how much I care about someone, I can't seem to bring myself to trust them all that much with my heart. So along the same vein, I have a set code of beliefs that I follow religiously. But in following those beliefs I sometimes find myself very sad just not break my code and help someone else live theirs.

I find that by being enthusiastic, happy, and a generator of good energy, I find not only others feeling the same way--but myself as well. Everyone benefits, and I think it's important to recognize good in the world, even when it seems like things aren't right, or everything's going wrong. By being a positive person, I enjoy spreading that happiness, which allows me to be open-minded at the same time. I get the chance to think outside of the box when I take the time to be open and kind to others. To see from another's perspective is truly eye-opening.  Because I tend to genuinely care about others, overthinking and being too selfless sometimes can be two of my worst qualities/traits. My best interests often occur to help others and be there for them at all costs; I am an incredibly loyal and honest friend. When that is not reciprocated or people lie or cheat to me in order to obtain something from me, I generally recognize it and avoid negativity; however, there are situations where I am caught off-guard, and it does hurt me emotionally because my best intentions lie in helping others since I know that I can help myself and am a strong individual. When it comes to those that I care about, I also sometimes overthink in situations by overanalyzing or reading in to things too much, which can be harmful and detrimental to relationships. I feel like I have gotten better at that though since I am a trusting person.",2,,,Yes--was very sick from a chronic illness,14,15,6,14,6,10,4,14,15,10,7,7,7,7,1,2,2,1,3,5,5,2,1,5,3,1,4,4,3,5,1,2,1,1,5,2,1,4,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,4,18,16,18,12,18,16,18,18,14,16,18,17,18,18,13,16,5,14,5,12,16,14,18,14,16,18,16,13,4,18,18,18,12,18,16,10,5,18,8,18,16,12,18,18,18,18,18,18,18,18,16,16,18,14,18,11,18,18,18,20,20,20,20,12,12,12,12,12,10,7,7,10,10,10,7,3,1,1,

Many people turn to me in times of trouble as I believe they know I am reliable, and loyal supporter. It takes some creativity to express these qualities; and I am constatntly brainstorming ways I can improve my situational awareness at work, home and play.   Although creativity can take me through many relationships, fun experiences, opportunites to grow professionally; this creative and curious spirit takes me off task and my follow through is lacking. Currently my personal goals include to adresss this creative workflow in my brain and worklife so that other things naturally fall into place without unorganized disasters occuring.

Even when we feel exhausted, if someone invites us out we get out of our pajamas and join the fun. I would usually like to be up and doing something with other people (being social) rather than sitting and/or being alone. However, I make an exception to going to the movies. But I guess that requires some sort of energy as well, because a lot of people are too lazy to leave the house and would rather just watch netflix! I think I'm amusing because I'm constantly entertaining people and saying ridiculous things. I like attention and humor and try to keep my conversations as interesting as possible (hence: amusing. Boring conversations would be the opposite).  My worst qualities are tiring and annoying because obviously not everyone can keep up with endless bundles of energy. Also, I manage my time very effectively and can finish my schoolwork quite quickly most of the time, so I always am trying to get people to accompany me, which can get tiring for others...so my greatest strength leads to my greatest flaw!

I was raised to be nice to everyone, even those who aren't always kind in return, and now it is just natural for me to try and look for the best in others and treat them how I would like to be treated. Being open-minded is a trait that has grown in me since going to college; Washington University  has a much more diverse population than I have encountered before and I have come across so many new opinions. Instead of criticizing ideas that are contrary to my own, I actually enjoy hearing about them to understand how people think and if their information on a topic is something that would change my own.   Indecisiveness and being too sensitive to criticism are also two traits that affect my daily life a great deal. I am very indecisive about everything-- from what to eat for dinner to what activity I should spend my free time doing. It is something that I find really annoying, especially when I just want to get something done but take forever to just get started because I can't decide on what to do first. I am also very sensitive to criticism, even little comments that people don't intend to be hurtful I often think a lot about. Criticism, whether it is over some irrelevant matter or something important, upsets me more than it should, even when it is constructive.

I'm not the smartest person I know, but I am smarter than most of the people I've met. My intelligence is the only quality in myself that I am absolutely sure of, and I do actually use it for the betterment of others however I can. As for creativity, I have many original ideas for what I can accomplish in my writing, which is what I wish to pursue when I finish my education. In several other cases, I have devised original ideas for how to solve problems. I have always been interested in constructing new things and new ways to do things, and I have often considered different paths in life I could have taken that would have utilized this trait in a different way (e.g. engineering instead of literature).  I have always been relatively reclusive, preferring to keep to myself rather than socialize with others. I feel like I am competent at interacting with other people, but I often feel out of place in conversations or large groups, and more comfortable when on my own. I tend to avoid socializing whenever I can, and get anxious when thinking about being at large gatherings or when having to contact people that I am not already familiar with. In regards to my sense of humor, I am just not a very funny person. Whenever I make jokes, other people tend to get angry or annoyed at me for making such bad jokes (not tasteless--just not funny). This isn't just true of strangers, it's true of many of my closest friends as well. Moreover, while I often take the jokes of others in stride, I tend to take certain jokes more personally than others would, and often fail to pick up on jokes when I should.",2,,,,1,3,1,1,11,8,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,5,1,4,1,3,1,2,4,5,4,1,2,1,1,1,4,1,1,5,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,5,18,16,6,8,13,4,11,7,11,4,15,13,11,7,15,4,11,5,10,8,5,11,7,12,10,18,5,4,10,14,15,13,19,11,6,12,4,5,15,11,6,4,14,12,6,14,7,12,13,12,4,17,13,6,13,19,12,14,11,19,20,19,20,12,12,12,12,12,10,10,7,7,7,10,5,3,1,1,

Personally I'm not sure if it's calm composure or downright indifference, but I almost never get really upset, worried, or lose my temper in stressful situations.  I like to think it saves me a lot of time and energy. It is not entirely unrelated to my laziness, which is a bad quality all around.  Nothing good comes from laziness and I can put forth my life so far as a testament to that.  Even as I type this, I am mildly surprised by my willingness to do it at all.  But of course, if it is for science.  Cliche as it may sound, sentience is a gift that is both blessing and a curse.  Kind of like money: As long as you know you have it, it's a source of satisfaction - but the more you use it, the emptier you feel.

However, I chose attentive and caring as my best traits because I feel that I generally care for everyone I meet, even if we're not close, and I think I listen well to others, which would make me attentive. When I first meet people, I try to smile and be friendly by asking them questions to make them feel welcome and valued; I try to keep the questions ""safe,"" though, since I don't necessarily know what they're comfortable with disclosing. Whenever they talk, I make sure to stay interested, focusing on what they're saying and not on what I should say next or what I should eat for lunch. I try to pick up on how they're feeling, see if anything's bothering them, etc. On the other hand, I chose anxious and sensitive as my two worse qualities because I can get too caught up with what others think of me and the impression I make on them. The two qualities go hand in hand, I would say. Sometimes I'm anxious of what others think of me, and I become more sensitive to what they say.

I can't imagine what it would be like to be less confident. I generally don't like people who aren't confident, I don't understand how they even function. Scrappy is a quality I'm proud of because it's a quality I feel is less and less common, but is widely useful. I like knowing that no matter what I'm tasked with I'll find a way to complete the goal or succeed. And I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty or take action to do it. It's helpful in every part of my life.  Pride and vanity are my worst faults by far. Religiously I feel bad about having them, being the major sins that they are, but in my worst times I'm loathe to admit that they're bad things. My vanity I think is a part of my pride, because I have no desire for a partner so there's no practical reason for me to be so conscious of my looks- it's mostly a power thing, a pride thing. The pride I know is a bad thing but often have a hard time really believing because there's no problem with being proud of yourself and your accomplishments when you have them to be proud of. Where it does cause me distress is when it conflicts with my admitting I did something wrong.

With them, I could be comfortable and share my feelings. I'd always been a genuine person inside, but I never found people that would share their stories with me or people who cared about how I was truly feeling. So making these friends helped me be more genuine and comfortable enough to tell jokes.   I am very careless when it comes to many things.

That aspect of my ""job"" has not only increased the level of hard work and compassion that I strive to posses; it has shown me how important hard work and compassion can be in someone's life, as well. I value those traits in others because compassion inspires people to take action to help others and hard work ensures that the actions taken are not futile. Indecisiveness sometimes can put a strain on my relationships because, in my desire to be easy to please (and, in actuality, I consider myself relatively easy to please), I sometimes forget that continuously asking others to make decisions is exhausting for them. It is also easy to allow my own ideas to fall by the wayside in the name of cooperation and teamwork when, in reality, I simply appear to be indecisive. I am not forgetful when it comes to remembering information--especially school work and intellectual information.

I believe that I make a good and honest effort to pursue achieving these goals, whether by doing a lot or a little, each and every day. I think this is one of my strongest qualities because it shows that I can adapt to any situation, whether personal or professional, and be successful in it. I listed trustworthiness because I have been told how much people value someone they can count on and I think there is evidence enough in my relationships to suggest that I am a trustworthy person.  It is important to be able to feel good about the things you succeed at in life, no matter how big or how small. I tend to find a way to make every success not quite good enough to really feel satisfied with the outcome. Being overly critical also lends itself to indecision at the most inopportune times. If not properly managed and worked on being overly critical can become quite crippling.   No one likes to be called a liar, yet I find myself thinking that every story people tell is inflated to make themselves look better and that every head line has a secret agenda behind it rather than the truth. So much of life is made up of relationships that if one cannot find a way to trust others they soon find themselves living in a very sad and lonely existence.

I am most proud of my incredibly strong work ethic and how much I care for my friends and family. I also think these two characteristics largely shape how others see me. My friends and family have always noted how hard I work. I am very proud of how hard I work because I think the hours I have put into various activities such as sports ,but especially academics, have allowed me to be successful as I am, especially at Wash U. I truly think that it is the hours I put in to studying , above all else,  have allowed me to maintain a high G.P.A. I also think my work ethic will allow me to be successful in the future. I think caring for others is very important as well and I admire those who are willing to go above and beyond to help their friends or family. So, though it is sometimes said in a patronizing way, I am proud that my friends call me Mom. I also think being caring has allowed me to forge stronger friendships, which I value greatly.   Though my anxiety sometimes drives me to work harder (because I am anxious about grades), I know and feel that ultimately it is not a good quality to have and can be detrimental to my well being. I would say being self-conscious and anxious are my worst qualities because they steal my confidence and make me feel awful. I do not enjoy constantly worrying about grades, friendships, how my body looks, or whatever else my anxiety is centered around. I hate that I base part of  my confidence on my looks and am therefore consistently critical of how I look and also self conscious. So both my anxiety and self consciousness fuel each other and leave me feeling nervous, unsettled, or unsatisfied which is why I believe they are my worst qualities.

It drives me crazy when people tell me that ""things just come easily"" to me. I work very hard for everything that I've ever accomplished and I pride myself on that. I'm not the kind of person who will do something quick just to get it done; I'll always take my time and do it the right way. I'll try everything in my power to do every task I'm faced with to the best of my ability.   I also pride myself on being trustworthy; finding people who you can trust is difficult these days. I would like to think that I know when to keep things to myself and when to share them with others. I love it when my friends come to me for advice or just to get something off of their chest. It means a lot to me when people can completely open up to me and tell me whatever is on their mind, and I do my best to make that clear to all of my close friends.   I procrastinate like no other when it comes to getting work done (hence this survey having to be sent to me twice), and I honestly am not sure why. I always work better under pressure, but that's still no excuse. If i have two weeks to write a paper, I'll probably start it the night before it's due. This is something that I really need to work on, especially because I was quite unhappy with the grades I received last year.  I'm a huge worrier, and that causes me a ton of stress that I just don't need in my life. I tend to expect the worst of every situation, even when I know that, in reality, everything will work out for the best in the end.

I am involved in a student group on campus that trained me as a peer counselor, where I talk with and console clients that come into our office or call on our phone line. My friends have always turned to me when they needed to talk, but since I have joined this student group, my friends and family immediately turn to me. I love to help others through difficult times, and I am really glad that I received proper training to make the most impact; however, a lot of my time is spent helping others with their concerns. As a result, I often feel that I don't live in the moment or think about myself often enough. Although I would much rather give my time helping others and making sure those around me are doing well, it is a double-headed sword.  Furthermore, I have devoted a lot my time to volunteer work that I find immensely fulfilling. It really is important to me that others less fortunate than I am are receiving assistance in some form. I honestly believe that my compassion and sense of caring for friends, family, and strangers is one of my most redeeming qualities.  On the other hand, I do often feel lazy and that I waste my time doing activities that don't amount to enough in the long run. I am a very busy person--I am involved in many student groups and take about 18 credits a semester--and I think being busy is a fault. Even when I have free time, I tend to waste it by lying in bed or watching TV when there are many other things I should be doing.

With my friends, I am someone they can tell anything, and I will lend an ear to their struggles, problems, etc, and can be a source of some comfort and advice. Along these same lines, my friends and family can depend on me to help with almost anything whenever I can, from tutoring help to moving. I make sure to be there for the people closest to me.  I have a very assertive personality, and talk a lot, which sometimes can make me a tough pill to swallow. I bring a lot of energy to most situations, and as a result can overpower conversations. I often find myself talking too much at the expense of listening to what others have to say. I also tend to see things as very fixed, especially people, and am quick to like or dislike individuals.

Most conditions, whether they be in work or friendship, are subject to change over time due to a variety of forces, so I am great at remaining calm and anticipating those changes. Part of this is that I know what it feels like (and I am comfortable with the feeling) of being let down or disappointed and moving on. I have received a fair number of job offer rejections and know what it is like to under-perform in school, so I have really learned to role with the punches that life throws at me. I think of times as a catering manager where I was forced to be adaptable to the whims of our clients and the time that my dad fractured his neck in Costa Rica and I had to step in as the 13 year old translator for his medical treatment as foundational experiences in fostering one of my best qualities which is adaptability.  I am tenacious because I am the ultimate competitor when I am up against myself and my personal limits. I am tenacious partly to prove to others that I can exceed expectations of performance, but I also am just constantly thinking of how I can do better or improve. Being tenacious can be exhausting mentally and physically, because no one can always be outperforming their last achievement, but I get a charge out of seeing myself improve (even marginally) with each attempt I give something, whether it being a work assignment or a rock climbing route. I think that tenacity is one of my best traits because it applies to all my life's endeavors.  Being easily distracted is one of my worst qualities, but also something that is rooted in something I am proud of: my diversity of interests. I am a curious person and I am invigorated by all knowledge, so sometimes it is difficult for me to stay focused particularly when I lack direction and instruction. It is really when I am left up to my own devices and forced to design my own strategy of accomplishing something where distraction becomes a problem, and I wish I was better at being self-motivated on tasks that are important to me.  Indecisiveness is another ""bad"" quality of mine because it means that I feel like I have lost many opportunities because of my inability to make a quick decision or go after exactly what I want. I tend to overanalyze decisions and think that cons outweigh pros and use that as an excuse not to do anything at all",2,,,I had a girlfriend this summer but then we just broke up.,12,9,7,8,8,4,13,10,12,9,5,6,5,5,2,4,2,2,5,5,4,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,3,2,1,4,2,4,3,3,4,2,1,2,2,1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,7,10,10,7,5,10,12,6,6,12,10,10,11,11,13,7,11,8,8,10,10,6,11,8,13,6,12,11,6,6,8,10,7,6,12,10,11,19,6,12,19,11,8,11,11,11,12,8,11,10,12,7,6,10,11,10,10,11,11,7,18,17,17,18,16,16,15,17,16,6,6,6,7,6,7,4,4,1,2,

I firstly give them my attention -- I am very often sensitive to the moods and desires of those around me -- and then as best I can I give them a positive outlook and confidence, and empower them to do their best. I feel like if I can maintain that positivity in my interactions with myself and the world, I'll be able to go as far as I possibly can in life. And because my sensitivity to others is so keen, I feel like it will be one of my best assets in doing what I want to do.     The biggest detriments, then, are those listed above. Often times I have trouble pushing myself to do what I want to do on a larger scale, the ability for which I describe as self-discipline. I feel like if I can foster discipline within myself, I can push myself to be better than my undesirable habits and tendencies.     When it comes to developing self-discipline however, as well as various other fields (like being creative, persevering on assignments, or doing the things that are hardest for me, like writing or paperwork), I feel like I'm sometimes set back by uncertainty as to whether I can accomplish the thing I want to do. I think I sometimes don't work as hard as I could if I already knew I could do something. If I were to charge into these hardest things with full confidence, I would better be able to keep a healthy, positive attitude that I know helps me so much.

I really hope it can still be helpful. I would like to change the person who I talk about at the end, if at all possible. Like I said earlier, I identify as transgender, and prefer she/her pronouns. If there's anywhere you guys store that information, I'd appreciate it if you changed it. In addition, I know that's in some ways more than just a major life event, so I'm happy to come in and talk more or respond more via survey if either of those are appropriate.  Best,     Korigan"
