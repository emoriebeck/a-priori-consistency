I continue to try and become a better person than before. During this search, I felt that my tolerance of others is one of my best qualities because it keeps conflicts from happening between me and others. From this tolerance, I can determine how to best aide others instead of trying to one-up them. Additionally with others, I'm enthusiastic to become friends with them. Instead of looking for conflict, I go for a community environment of working together. However I still have my flaws which I definitely need to work on. I chose easily distracted because it seems I'm always not doing what I should be doing because I'm distracted with something else. For example, just writing these paragraphs took so much longer because I looked at Facebook way too many times. My other flaw is talking without thinking because, while I'm enthusiastic to be with others, many times I let my mouth run before realizing the consequences. My girlfriend also comments on this flaw frequently. My goal is to learn to concentrate and think before I speak - or at least assess the consequences more.

My intelligence has also impacted my abilities in social circles, since I tend to be able to fit in with different circles simply by knowing information about their shared interests.  Along with this, my open-mindedness has proven invaluable.  Not only has it earned me friends and a career, but it has also opened my eyes to many different types of people that many others close themselves off to.  However, I am told that I can be quite condescending, which is the hubris of intelligence.  Sometimes I act like I am smarter than others, since I explain things they already understand.  In my mind, it just reads as making sure we are on the same page, but apparently it comes of as condescending.  Along with this, I tend to think about the facts before I speak.

It wasn't an easy decision, but I am happy that I was able to do so. I said that compassion is one of my best qualities because I think it's really important to see things from other people's persepctive and to do your best to lend a hand whenever and whereever you can, and I like that I genuinely care about the well-being of others.  I said that my inattentiveness is one of my worst traits because I have noticed that I have a tendency to not really listen when people are talking to me. I not and smile, and comment appropriately, but when they walk away, or the next day, or a week later, I realise that I have no idea what I talked about with that person. I don't remember the details of people's live that they tell me about, and tehn I feel really bad when they remember something I told them about myself, and remember to take the time to follow up on something I may have said I was struggling with, but I can't remember specific details about their lives. And I don't mean to come off as shallow or uncaring, because I really do care about what they have to say, what people are going through, and what they tell me. I really do care about people's personal lives, I just can't seem to remember, just like I can't seem to remember names to save my life. So that is something that I have started trying to make a conscious effort to work on. I said that my other worst quality is my idecisiveness.

I am not afraid to make ideas into reality, I like to explore and to experiment. If something hasn't been tried, might as well try it and see if it works. To some degree, this relates to a personal interest in putting more things in the world that fascinate others. Everyone has so much they could be fascinated in if they opened their eyes, I think. I am easily fascinated by most things. I knit the sweaters on the bunny statue and I ran around campus as a ghost with my buddy pacman on Halloween because I want the world to be filled with original and fascinating things, and if they aren't there, I will put them there.   Thoughtful was a tricky word, I meant to say that I put a lot of thought into all things. Actually I maybe should have said understanding. I am very aware of the people I am around, and that I don't know everything.  I am the least road rage effected person ever, I am never in a position to make judgements about other drivers because I literally know nothing about whats going on with them, who knows if they picked up an injured bird, have a crazy child fight going on in the backseat, are rushing to aid an injured relative. I err on the side of caution, and unless anyone is literally putting my life in danger, I'm quite tolerant. I am not empathetic, which will come up momentarily, but I'm not at all judgmental. I like to think about what is going on with everyone and just hold it in my mind as I observe the world.  Is there a word for not being empathetic? Thats what I meant. I just can't feel other people's emotions. Its that simple. It doesn't really bother me much, but it makes me sad when it makes my significant other sad that I can't empathize with things in his life. Sometimes I feel like I have an easier time imagining emotions of inanimate objects or animals than people, because people-emotions seem quite illogical at times because people have so much power to change their situation. I can't remember what I was supposed to be empathizing with him about, but for instance I have a friend right now in an emotional crisis regarding a relationship and I can talk with her about it, but I really just can't feel with her. I still don't really see this as a bad thing. Its just a thing. And I don't think I expect people to empathize with me either, people can only really really understand themselves.   Reclusive, I like being alone but this is related to social anxiety. I avoid spaces, activities, etc. because of social anxiety. Being around people I don't exactly know but should maybe know is uncomfortable, I'd rather be with total strangers or close friends, small talk is my least favorite thing. I sometimes find isolated places to eat alone because if I was eating alone in a public, visible space, people might see me and try to join me. I also do actually like social interaction most of the time, so this doesn't totally make sense and thats why I put it as a negative thing. There is nothing wrong with being alone and enjoying being alone, but being afraid of people in this way is rather maladaptive and nonsensical.

This ties in with the good sense of humor. I love to make my friends laugh and smile. I feel that I can help them through their problems by making them feel better, making them laugh and trying to help them see the bright side of any situation.  I would say that my two worst traits are that I'm brutally honest and easily frustrated. My honesty can be a good thing, especially when I know I have to tell someone something they need to hear that they don't necessarily want to. This can also be a bad thing. I have no problem telling people what they need to hear, but if someone's not ready for that, then they could get upset about what I'm telling them, even if I'm trying to help them. I also get easily frustrated, especially when driving. This isn't really a problem, but it's something I can try to work on.

However, I am still friends with everyone, and have been told multiple times that ""everyone loves me"". I think this is a good trait to have, as I don't have to worry about how this person doesn't like me or how that person doesn't like me, so I don't have to deal with that added stress. I think being a good listener ties in with the other trait, as actually listening to what other people say allows me to more understand them.  Not being assertive is something that I am trying to work on because I feel that sometimes I miss out on things because of lack of assertiveness. I can be shy, and don't much care for initiating conversations with people that I don't know, and I dislike speaking up if say someone at a restaurant got my order wrong, because I feel like I'm bothering the other person. I think that this is one of my worst traits because it prevents me from doing things that can benefit me such as networking. Being unmotivated kind of speaks for itself because lacking motivation can cause my grades to suffer when I don't put in as much work as I need to.

My stubbornness has been pointed out to me by some of the people who are closest to me. I think it is definitely a problem when my staunch beliefs stop me from listening to other people's point of views and having an open mind. It is something that I am constantly aware of now since it has been brought to my attention and is therefore something I think I need to work on the most.

I also have reflected on the successes and failures now that I have graduated on College and I think that the ability to think fast was part of the reason that I didn't fail out of college completely.  I have discussed at length on my tendency to be lazy in the surveys. I haven't been able to kick that habit, even though I've been trying. Lately, I've noticed that being lazy has even affected life outside of academics - I often find myself doing things like watching TV rather than more fulfilling activity in my downtime, like exercise. Fighting it has been a constant battle, and I think I'm getting it under control. As for fearful, I've noticed that I'm very afraid of any new activities.

I've reflected on that word a lot in the medical sense, being empathetic towards patients. I had a lot of medical problems growing up, and experienced the patient side of medicine. I feel that I am able to convey understanding and support to others, and I think that is a great quality. I chose engaging because I wanted a word to describe what I see as what makes me fun to be around. My friends and coworkers say that I am upbeat, funny, and positive, and I think that boils down to being engaging.   In this time since college, I have also had the time to reflect on my ADD. This is a diagnosis I have had since high school, and has shaped my personality my whole life. I felt I was able to master my academic skills a bit more in studying for the MCAT, but recently I have been struggling with getting a handle on disorganization and forgetfulness in the rest of my life. I chose those traits because they are what I think about the most in my every day life, when it is remembering to pick up dry cleaning or finishing taxes or responding to personal emails and texts.

This includes things like basketball, which I worked incredibly hard at to become better than a lot of people who were previously better than me.

This hinders me, because I often realize I get into arguments with people over really dumb things, or say, try to hard in a family ""pick up game"" of football or basketball.

I've never had too much respect for established norms of behavior. I'm more vocal about it than ever now. It tends to piss some people off. But even then, the irreverence is partially related to my honesty. I don't view it as much of a problem, but can definitely see how it upsets others. I'm not lonely. I have friends and can make conversation with people rather proficiently (though I don't sound like much of a cool kid when I put it that way). But I have a profound challenge legitimately connecting with most people. There's just a lot of psychic distance between me and the average person. Or maybe I'm just more painfully aware of it than others. Either way, it leads to a lot of personal suffering, and near-incessant undertones of solemnity.

My high school education didn't prepare me well for the rigors of WashU and I wouldn't consider myself someone who learns quickly, so I think that I owe whatever successes I've had to my tenacity and unwillingness to give up. I think that my openness to experience has helped me a great deal as well. Coming from a community that is 95% Hispanic, I think that my openness was what made me willing to quickly adapt to being around people of other cultures. It also helped me be more ambitious in pursuing risky experiences.  I think that my social skills are what are holding me back. I feel that, in order to really succeed in business school, I need to be charismatic. As hard as I try though, I just haven't been able to do this. I'm pretty good at making a few close friends, but charming a crowd is tough.

Later in life, my friends saw me as an approachable person. When my friends were going through rough times in their lives, they felt really comfortable reaching out to me for guidance and comfort. I don't mind being a soundboard for my family and friends if they have a need to vent about their problems. Ever since elementary school, I never liked being in the spotlight, even for praise on my achievements. I would usually either play down my achievements in school or never mention them at all. I did not wanted to be portrayed as an arrogant person, especially since I never saw myself as better than anybody else. Being that I have always been a shy person, I don't self-disclose what's going on with me or how I feel a lot of the times. Therefore, many of my friends believe that I am an aloof person.

My enthusiasm is great in both social and professional settings: it gives me drive to do my work thoroughly and makes me a more fun person to be around.   My pride and tendency to be judgmental go hand in hand: I feel that I have my life very well put together, and I've pulled through a lot of negative circumstances, so when I see others doing poorly or being wimpy in easier circumstances, i see them as weak. I know that this is not fair, as I can't accurately or appropriately judge others' life circumstances, and it is not my place to pass judgment on the strength of others at all, but it's what my mind does.

Since friendships are extremely important to me, I see this is as one of my best traits.  Ambitious is another great trait of mine because it leads me to start all sorts of different projects, take on new roles, be interested in all sorts of different things (another is curiosity) and generally leads me to do most of the different things I do in my life. Ambition is a key part of who I am.  I've learned at work here since graduation that I can be a bit more arrogant than I previously thought, especially when around people who I feel don't know as much about certain things as I do. The only reason I dislike this quality is because it makes other people dislike me or feel badly about themselves when I treat them like they don't know as much as I do. Again, relationships are important to me and this trait can negatively impact my relationships.  Fortunately, I generally see myself as a warm person, but I can be cold sometimes if I'm distracted or annoyed or upset, which is a trait I dislike in myself.

I am a list-maker and scheduler to ensure that I am responsible with my tasks.  I believe this is a positive trait, because it creates positive interpersonal relationships and leads people to entrust me with more responsibilities in a workplace environment. I said that needy is one of my worst qualities, because it often interferes with my ability to trust others, particularly in romantic relationships.  I like to know what others I'm closely involved with are doing and get worried when I don't have contact with them for extended periods of time (significant others more than friends).

I know it may be due to my anxiety and depression issues and my insecurities that I am not as good as other people who he may talk to (my insecurities may have stemmed from bullying in the past).

If someone is in distress, I will drop everything and do anything in my power to be there for them. This can be good and bad. Good in the sense that the relationships I have are ones with meaning but bad because I can also be emotionally influenced by the troubles of other people which can be tolling at times. I'm no Jon Stewart but I would say I know how to make a bad joke. To the point where people find this to be funny. In all honesty, I like making people laugh and its my way of showing people that its ok to have fun during times of stress or sadness. Being funny has been a coping mechanism for me as well as a way for me to enjoy the company of the people I'm with. I think I'm over sensitive to people's troubles as well as to criticism. I'm very conscious of other people's feelings and I never want to offend anybody. That's why not being assertive is also a one of my poorer qualities because I'm more reluctant to speak up if I think someone is wrong.

My humor helps me, and others, to stay positive, laugh, and enjoy even painful moments. It's the most sociable aspect of my personality.  I find my two biggest faults to be my argumentative and self-doubting nature. I don't find them to be true sources of contention, as much as others who are closest to me. I've been told I can find a reason to argue about anything, and that is true. However, I think its more apt to say I'm willing to contest anything I see fit if the need should arise, and I will not back down until I'm satisfied or it's necessary. I believe there is strength in this, but also weakness as I'm not always able to let small issues rest, and can at times irritate/alienate others. I would say self-doubt is necessary and humbling, but also destructive as I tend to overthink my words and actions, and that of others. I'm not nearly as spontaneous as I'd like to be, and I tend to second guess myself. As previously mentioned, it keeps me humble, but also a bit insecure - which is rarely necessary or helpful.

My intelligence is what has gotten me to where I am in life, and is what I consider to provide for my future.

It is practical for myself and for helping others, and is the most useful aspect of my personality. Creativity is less practical, but still important for me to be able to enjoy life, as well as what might potentially make me interesting to others. I am able to create new things, experiment, explore, and--combined with my intelligence--articulate ideas. Both intelligence and creativity are what determine who I am and what I can accomplish.  By over-certainty, I mean an insistence that I am right--not quite vanity or arrogance, but at least a stubbornness when dealing with others. Because I rely so heavily on my intelligence and my own reasoning, I often ignore or discount what others have to say because I have already found the ""right"" solution. By anger, I partially mean how quick I can be to anger, but also how my emotions can get in the way of my interpersonal relationships. Multiple friends have stated that they fear me and my reactions to criticism--my anger, and how easily it can be awakened, scares them.

I consider myself dependable due to the fact that I'm always available and willing to help someone that I love. Ever since I was 13, I've been dependable. I lived in a single parent household for the majority of my teenage years, and I had to watch over my little brother while my mom worked long hours. Being kind I guess stemmed from me being dependable and understanding to my family and friends when they were going through rough times. Being that many of my friends and family have gone through some pretty traumatic events in their lives, I end to be more quiet about my comparably smaller issues. Hence, I have always been a really reserved and modest person. I hate being a burden to others, so I usually keep to myself and figure out things on my own. ",2,,,An uncle passed away.
